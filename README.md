To Mr.K: 

When you're checking to make sure I did work: For some reason, some of my early commits don't show up on my <b>account</b>, even if they show up on the <b>history</b> of the repo, that is, those commits are not blamed on my account specifically (maybe because I was using the app at home?). That's why it seems like I didn't make commits early on in the project. However, those commits show up on the history of the repo, the ones without an image. 

Also, June 6th neither of us did anything because of SATII the day after. - JN
