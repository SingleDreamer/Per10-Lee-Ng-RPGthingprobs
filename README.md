This will probably be an RPG thing.

To Mr.K: When you're checking to make sure I did work: For some reason, some of my early commits don't show up on my <b>account</b>, even if they show up on the <b>history</b> of the repo, that is, those commits are not blamed on my account specifically (maybe because I was using the app at home?). That's why it seems like I didn't make commits early on in the project. However, those commits show up on the history of the repo, the ones without an image. - JN
